# Eluvio coding challenge 

## The main problems I would like to address.

* What are the topics in the news titles?
* Because news is inherently sequential and temporal, I want to know how the topic evolve over time. In other words, what happended, when and how long did it last?

## What I did.

* Preprocess the news titles for LDA model
* Determine the number of topics using topic coherence score 
* Fit LDA model for all news titles and return the topics 
* Link the topics at consecutive time based on Hellinger distance 

## Findings.
